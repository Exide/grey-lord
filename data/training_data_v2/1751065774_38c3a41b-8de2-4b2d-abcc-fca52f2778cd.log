        Newhaven, Village Entrance
             Welcome to Newhaven! You are standing at the crude
wooden gates of the village entrance, in the middle of a dusty path. A low
wooden palisade surrounds the village, to protect against creatures of the
night and random raiders. You can see small buildings to the north and south,
and a dusty path that leads to the west and southeast.
